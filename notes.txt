checks out the given commit
create a python scripts which runs the build for the profile
create a docker container with the image from the profile
- map the source directory and 
- map the directory with the python script
configure conan in the docker container
get the package name and version from the docker container and add them to the build
run the python script in the docker container
if no error:
  get the dependencies from the docker container and add them to the build
  run "conan upload <package_name>" in the docker container
  trigger the scheduler
if error:
